## Terminal

This is where the magic happens.

Themes included with this configuration:

1. **colorblind.terminal** - Black background, super vibrant colors
- **snowblind.terminal** - White background, vibrant colors
- **cataracts.terminal** - Grey background with muted colors
- **bloodshot.terminal** - Similar to colorblind but with muted colors

To use the Terminal themes, install [SIMBL 0.9.7](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) and save the [64 Bit Terminal Colors](http://github.com/timmfin/terminalcolours) plugin to:

    ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/
